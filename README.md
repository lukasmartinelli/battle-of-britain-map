## Edit the Style

Use the [Maputnik CLI](https://github.com/maputnik/editor) to edit and develop the style.
After you've started Maputnik open the editor on `localhost:8000`.

```
maputnik --watch --file style.json
```

You can also edit the style in Mapbox Studio by removing the video layer and source and uploading the
SVGs and style to Mapbox Studio.
